### Literature review

The Rashomon effect was introduced to predictive modelling in [Breiman and others, 2001]. It explained the concept of the Rashomon effect, gave examples of where it can be used and the benefits that it gives. In [Fisher and others, 2019] was given more instances of Rashomon usage. The paper describes ways to use the Rashomon effect to analyse variable importance. 

The development of mortality prediction models is popular in machine learning. Every created model is different when it comes to its performance and methodology. To organize achievements [Johnson and others, 2017] compared different models that predict mortality. They compare 38 experiments using 28 published studies and attempt to reproduce their code. The code they made is available on their Github page.
