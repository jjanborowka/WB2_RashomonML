### Abstract

The Rashomon effect refers to the moment when we have many accurate, but different models, that predict the same problem with the same data. To visualize the Rashomon effect we often use Partial Dependence Profile, which shows the relationship between a selected variable and the model's expected value prediction. In this paper, we analysed PD profiles for the mortality prediction model. First, we created a Random search on the Xgboost model from a paper that predicts death in ICU. Next, we created importance plots and PD curves and analysed the results. It turns out that the conclusions, that we drew from the plots are similar to the specialists' opinion. It indicates, that with using the Rashomon effect we can predict wanted values without specialised knowledge about the topic.
