### Methodology 

In our experiment, we want to use real data and use models in a similar way they may be used in commercial applications. Because of these two factors, we decide to use MIMIC database [@cyctay_mimica]. This base contains a very large quantity of real medical data and it's frequently used in machine learning oriented and other research. In our article, we use a subset of transformed features from this data directly correlated to patient health.

To crate, Rashomon set we needed to specify the exact task we want to test. To do this we examine already created articles about usage of this data in machine learning. We encountered many problems with reproducibility such as no longer supported or outdated code or badly optimize functions. Finaly decided to use previous research about reproducibility of MIMIC studies [@cyctat artykułu z reproduktywalnościa]. In this article, the researchers examine several articles involving MIMIC and try to replicate their results. In our study, we chose one of the analyzed articles. 
Chosen study [@cyctak tamtego artykuły który wybralismy] cocncern about predicting death probability during ICU stays. More detailed explanations about feature generation and record selection can be found in mentione article. 

To perform our analysis we create extreme gradient boosting (farther referred to as XGB) models from package [@cytowanie pakietu]. We decide to use XGB because of his relative sensitivity to hyperparameters. Models were trained using random search with 1000 iterations and 3 folds. Data were split randomly to each fold. Hyperparametr space used in training can be found [@cytownaie artykuł z hypeparamerami]. This article contains recommended parameter spaces for this type of research. In the evaluation and selection of models, we used mean accuracy across folds and decide to chose a subset of models over a certain thresh hold. To examine how selected models work we used feature importance plots with drop-out loss as a metric from packed [@dalex] and partial dependency plots (farther referred as PDP) also from the same package.
