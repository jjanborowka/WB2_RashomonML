Firstly, we take a look at the generated feature importance plots. The most notable thing about them is that they do not differ a lot from one another. The three most important features are the same for almost every model although with different rankings. These features include age and two measures referring to Glasgow Coma Scale. The rankings of the other features vary across all models, but their importance also diminishes rapidly. And that brings another issue – even the most important features have very low drop-out loss. Overall, it seems that most of the models have a lot of similarly important features rather than only a few of significantly increased importance.

In the second part of our analysis, we focus on the created PDP plots. The curves of various models from the Rashomon set appear quite similar to one another. There are some slight differences, but not as many nor as big as we expected. Instead, we come to another conclusion - from these plots one can learn about the features themselves. The most obvious are the trends for data like age, oxygen saturation level, white blood count or Glasgow Coma Scale values. It is clearly visible how these variables relate approximately linearly to the death prediction. Another and perhaps more interesting conclusion is to be drawn from the sodium level plot. Thanks to the big, sudden shift of all the models’ curves it is possible to find out the values of normal sodium levels at 135-145 units [@cyt poprawne poziomy]. It is surprising to be able to find these levels so accurately relying only on the data, without any kind of professional knowledge.
